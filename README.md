# ChatsApp

This is a real time room based chatting app. Here a user can Login/Register and then user have to Create or Join in a particular chat room to start chatting in the room.

For this project,

- In backend I used Node with Express and MongoDB as database. I also used GraphQL instead of REST API though there is two REST API route.
- In frontend, I used React with NextJS. I used Redux for state management. For this particular app, Redux was not a must but it'll help to scale the project further. I also used GraphQL client to interact with backend GraphQL.

The project directory structure is mostly self explanatory, the directory _backend_ contains all the code for backend. The directory _client_ contains all the codes for frontend.
